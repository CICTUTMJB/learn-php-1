    <p>
      <strong>LANGLEY, VA</strong>—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office
      of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured
      hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with
      black highlighters.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the
      most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders
      the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
      began at the agency's inception in 1947.

    <p>
      CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably
      never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the Cold War </li>
      <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
      <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      
    </ul>
